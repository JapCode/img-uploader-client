# Image uploader client

This is a repo for the client side of a image uploader, a little project, which created using React.js, Tailwind, packaging with vite, using eslint how static test and prettier for format the code.

For React i'm using context and custom hooks for managing the state of the context because context generate multiple renders and the purpose of these hooks together to the useMemo prevent this from happening

## You can view the deploy project in this [Link](https://img-uploader-react.herokuapp.com) and if you want to see the repo for the server side you can view this [Repo](https://github.com/JapCode/img-uploader-server)
